PCC Commute Lab – Sprint Intentions
-----------------------------------

Cadence: Two weeks per sprint
Start: August 25, 2025
End: December 2025 (finals week)

Sprint 0 (Aug 25 – Sep 7)
Intention: Get the project on its feet. Set up the repo, publish something 
simple,
and orient myself with my classes and this workflow.

Sprint 1 (Sep 8 – Sep 21)
Intention: Begin shaping the site into something that looks real.
Play with layout, start thinking about data, and make sure I’m not falling 
behind in class.

Sprint 2 (Sep 22 – Oct 5)
Intention: Add the first real signs of interactivity.
Experiment with simple JavaScript and keep the idea of commute data in 
mind.

Sprint 3 (Oct 6 – Oct 19)
Intention: Wrap the first course (CIS 192) on a strong note.
Polish the basics, keep the repo clean, and prep for the next phase.

Sprint 4 (Oct 20 – Nov 2)
Intention: Dive deeper with JavaScript in CIS 193.
Make the site feel alive and connect it more closely to real commute 
experiences.

Sprint 5 (Nov 3 – Nov 16)
Intention: Add actual commute data.
Find a way to represent time, distance, or modes visually so it’s not just 
a demo site.

Sprint 6 (Nov 17 – Dec 1)
Intention: Refine and expand. Improve usability, make the project 
accessible,
and start writing down how to present it.

Sprint 7 (Dec 2 – Dec 15)
Intention: Final polish. Prepare something I can show off proudly to 
classmates,
professors, and maybe even coworkers at Public Works. Frame it as a tool 
that
could eventually help staff consider alternatives to driving.

-----------------------------------
This plan is flexible. Each sprint is a checkpoint where I can look back,
adjust course, and keep building momentum toward the end of Fall 2025.
