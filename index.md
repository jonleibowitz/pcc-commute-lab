# 🚍 PCC Commute Lab

Welcome to the **PCC Commute Lab** — a student project exploring the commutes of Pasadena City College students and staff.  
This site will grow over the Fall 2025 semester as part of coursework in Web Development, Statistics, and Business Communications.

## What You’ll Find Here

- 📊 Data and charts about commute times, distances, and travel modes  
- 🗺️ Visualizations of how people get to campus (bus, car, bike, walk)  
- 📝 Project notes, updates, and documentation  

## Current Status

The project is in its early stages. Right now, you’ll mostly see scaffolding — but new features, datasets, and visualizations will be added as the semester progresses.

Check back for updates, or follow along on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonleibowitz/pcc-commute-lab).
