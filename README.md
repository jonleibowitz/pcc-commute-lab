# PCC Commute Lab

**PCC Commute Lab** is an evolving web project built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages.  
The goal is to create a useful, open resource for visualizing the commutes of Pasadena City College students and staff â€” highlighting **distance, time, and modes of transportation**.

This project is being developed alongside coursework in **Web Development (CIS 192/193)**, **Statistics (STAT C1000)**, and **Business Communications (BUS 011A)** during Fall 2025. It serves both as a technical learning environment and as a portfolio project that blends data analysis with clear communication.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Build a responsive site structure using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jekyll.
- Collect and visualize commute-related data (distance, time, transit/bike/car/walk).
- Integrate simple statistical analysis and charts for comparison.
- Communicate results in a professional, accessible format.


## ðŸš¦ Current Status

- Repository initialized
- Jekyll scaffold in place
- GitHub Pages configured
- Early planning for commute dataset collection

## ðŸ“Œ Roadmap (High-Level)

- **Phase 1:** Basic site layout and static content  
- **Phase 2:** Collect sample commute datasets  
- **Phase 3:** Add interactivity and visualizations (charts, maps)  
- **Phase 4:** Expand with analysis, presentations, and documentation
